# What does the backend do?
The backend has an API that takes multiple optional input(s) of Car manufacturerâ€™s (Make) name (full or partial name), model name (full or partial model name), budget in USD, and/or model year or a combination of any these input variables and returns the following search results in REST friendly format:

1. Total Number of vehicles available that matches the faceted search parameters
2. Number of vehicles matched by Make and Model combination as a sub-group of Total Number
3. Lowest, Median, and Highest Price of the vehicle that matches the price
4. 5 Suggested vehicles that are within a given budget. Sort by price in ascending order. Distinct Brand. ( Budget range is 10% of given budget. For example: A budget of 25k will yield vehicles with pricing between 22,500 and 27,500 )

## Cache
* The backend has a memory cache. If the user make the same request again, it will return the cached response.
* The cache system has been implemented using `memory-cache`
