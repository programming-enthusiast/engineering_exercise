Problem Statement:

+ Create an API that takes multiple optional input(s) of Car manufacturer’s (Make) name (full or partial name), model name (full or partial model name), budget in USD, and/or model year or a combination of any these input variables and returns the following search results in REST friendly format:

* Total Number of vehicles available that matches the faceted search parameters
* Number of vehicles matched by Make and Model combination
* Lowest, Median, and Highest Price of the vehicle that matches the price

Requirements:

+ Develop a fully REST compliant HTTP API
+ Publish your code along with any data sets used on your GitHub page
+ Create a Readme for your project on how to use, build, install, and run
+ Create any additional instructions / documentation as you see helpful
+ Must work through command line / shell (should not require us to use an IDE)
+ Must pass the unit tests created by the interviewer (will not be disclosed to you ahead of time)
+ Must have the ability to handle and simulate a system error and should be documented and handled properly according to REST semantics
+ Test must be returned within 48 hours (will check the latest commit timestamp on your GitHub for qualification)


Required Technical Stack:

+ Must be created either using JavaScript, Typescript (preferred), or Go lang ONLY
+ Can use any open source frameworks, plugins that are available through public code artifactories (e.g., npm) {cannot use unpublished GitHub source code}
+ Bonus points for limiting the number of open source frameworks utilized to deliver the functionality
+ Use JSON Server or other in-memory persistence layer to store the data sets provided by us or created by you for your exercise (do not use file system in your API code)

Reference data - Attached is a randomized vehicle statistics snapshot for your exercise.



Test review criteria:
+ Project scaffolding and Git friendliness
+ Clean & self-documented code
+ Domain Model suitability
+ Design Patterns usage
+ Usage of modern language practices (e.g., async, avoiding loops, etc.,)

Post Test Interview process:

+ There will be 2 interviews after the test has been successfully submitted
+ 1 Interview will be focused on submitted exercise, code review, and requirements validation
+ 1 Interview will be focused on your experience working in —> agile environments, interactions with QA Automation teams, technical collaboration style, and ability to receive and provide honest feedback to team
